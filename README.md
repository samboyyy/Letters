# Letters [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/samboyyy/Letters?label=Latest%20Release&style=flat)](https://github.com/samboyyy/Letters/releases)

🎉 Letters is a simple and modern Paper plugin for customizing server messages.
Server messages shouldn't be hard to change, they're just [Letters](https://github.com/samboyyy/Letters) on the screen
anyway 😉.
This plugin makes it easy to control and customize the default messages on your server.

## ✨ Features

The plugin lets you customize messages for the following most common server events.

- Player join and first join
- Player quit
- Player death
- Player chat
- Player whisper (`/tell`, `/msg`, `/w`)
- Player advancements

If you use a vanish plugin like SuperVanish or PremiumVanish,
join and quit messages will hide or show correctly when players vanish or reappear.

The plugin makes it easy to manage message behavior without using multiple plugins by letting you set different messages
for

- Everyone on the server
- Specific [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/) groups
- Individual players by username

To make sure you can customize messages however you like, the plugin supports

- Classic Minecraft [`&` color and formatting codes](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Formatting_codes)
- PaperMC [MiniMessage formatting](https://docs.papermc.io/adventure/minimessage/format/)
- Built in placeholders for each event
- [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) for extra placeholders from other plugins

## 🏷️ Placeholders

The plugin includes basic placeholders for every message type.
These are listed in the default config file with examples of how they work.
For more placeholders, you can install [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) and any
expansion packs you need.

## 🎨 Formatting

You can format messages using [classic Minecraft codes](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Formatting_codes) like `&a` for green
text or `&l` for bold text.  
You can also use PaperMC's [MiniMessage](https://docs.papermc.io/adventure/minimessage/format/) format for cleaner
formatting,
such as `<green>` for green text or `<bold>` for bold.

## ⚙️ Configuration

All the messages used by the plugin are stored in and can be customized in `config.yml`.
Messages follow a well-defined priority order which is

- `Player specific > LuckPerms group based > Default messages`

Messages can be disabled by setting them to empty strings (`""`).
The default config includes examples and all built in placeholders,
making it easy to get started.

```yml
messages:
  default:
    join:
      - "[...]"
    quit:
      - "[...]"

    # Default messages apply to all players unless they are overridden.
    # You can find examples for all supported events in the default config file.

  group_based:
    admin:
      join:
        - "[...]"
      quit:
        - "[...]"

    # Add more groups using the same format.
    # Group names must match LuckPerms group names exactly.

  player_specific:
    Notch:
      join:
        - "[...]"
      quit:
        - "[...]"

    # Add more players using the same format.
    # Player names must match usernames exactly.
```

## 📦 Download

You can download a ready to use JAR file from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/samboyyy/Letters/releases) page
